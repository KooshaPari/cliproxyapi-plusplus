# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents working with code in this repository.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build
go build -o cliproxy ./cmd/cliproxy

# Run
./cliproxy --config config.yaml

# Docker
docker compose up -d
```

## Environment

```bash
# Required environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

## Development Philosophy

### Extend, Never Duplicate

- NEVER create a v2 file. Refactor the original.
- NEVER create a new class if an existing one can be made generic.
- NEVER create custom implementations when an OSS library exists.
- Before writing ANY new code: search the codebase for existing patterns.

### Primitives First

- Build generic building blocks before application logic.
- A provider interface + registry is better than N isolated classes.
- Template strings > hardcoded messages. Config-driven > code-driven.

### Research Before Implementing

- Check pkg.go.dev for existing libraries.
- Search GitHub for 80%+ implementations to fork/adapt.

## Library Preferences (DO NOT REINVENT)

| Need | Use | NOT |
|------|-----|-----|
| HTTP router | chi | custom router |
| Logging | zerolog | fmt.Print |
| Config | viper | manual env parsing |
| Validation | go-playground/validator | manual if/else |
| Rate limiting | golang.org/x/time/rate | custom limiter |

---

## Code Quality Non-Negotiables

- Zero new lint suppressions without inline justification
- All new code must pass: go fmt, go vet, golint
- Max function: 40 lines
- No placeholder TODOs in committed code

---

## Verifiable Constraints

| Metric | Threshold | Enforcement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Tests | 80% coverage | CI gate |
| Lint | 0 errors | golangci-lint |
| Security | 0 critical | trivy scan |

## Provider Support

| Provider | Auth | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| OpenAI | API Key | ✅ |
| Anthropic | API Key | ✅ |
| Azure OpenAI | API Key/OAuth | ✅ |
| Google Gemini | API Key | ✅ |
| AWS Bedrock | IAM | ✅ |
| Kiro (CodeWhisperer) | OAuth | ✅ |
| GitHub Copilot | OAuth | ✅ |
| Ollama | Local | ✅ |

## Phenotype Org Cross-Project Reuse Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_SHARED_REUSE_PROTOCOL -->

- Treat this repository as part of the broader Phenotype organization project collection, not an isolated codebase.
- During research and implementation, actively identify code that is sharable, modularizable, splittable, or decomposable for reuse across repositories.
- When reusable logic is found, prefer extraction into existing shared modules/projects first; if none fit, propose creating a new shared module/project.
- Include a `Cross-Project Reuse Opportunities` section in plans with candidate code, target shared location, impacted repos, and migration order.
- For cross-repo moves or ownership-impacting extractions, ask the user for confirmation on destination and rollout, then bake that into the execution plan.
- Execute forward-only migrations: extract shared code, update all callers, and remove duplicated local implementations.
## Phenotype Git and Delivery Workflow Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_GIT_DELIVERY_PROTOCOL -->

- Use branch-based delivery with pull requests; do not rely on direct default-branch writes where rulesets apply.
- Prefer stacked PRs for multi-part changes so each PR is small, reviewable, and independently mergeable.
- Keep PRs linear and scoped: one concern per PR, explicit dependency order for stacks, and clear migration steps.
- Enforce CI and required checks strictly: do not merge until all required checks and policy gates are green.
- Resolve all review threads and substantive PR comments before merge; do not leave unresolved reviewer feedback.
- Follow repository coding standards and best practices (typing, tests, lint, docs, security) before requesting merge.
- Rebase or restack to keep branches current with target branch and to avoid stale/conflicting stacks.
- When a ruleset or merge policy blocks progress, surface the blocker explicitly and adapt the plan (for example: open PR path, restack, or split changes).
## Phenotype Long-Term Stability and Non-Destructive Change Protocol <!-- PHENOTYPE_LONGTERM_STABILITY_PROTOCOL -->

- Optimize for long-term platform value over short-term convenience; choose durable solutions even when implementation complexity is higher.
- Classify proposed changes as `quick_fix` or `stable_solution`; prefer `stable_solution` unless an incident response explicitly requires a temporary fix.
- Do not use deletions/reversions as the default strategy; prefer targeted edits, forward fixes, and incremental hardening.
- Prefer moving obsolete or superseded material into `.archive/` over destructive removal when retention is operationally useful.
- Prefer clean manual merges, explicit conflict resolution, and auditable history over forceful rewrites, force merges, or history-destructive workflows.
- Prefer completing unused stubs into production-quality implementations when they represent intended product direction; avoid leaving stubs ignored indefinitely.
- Do not merge any PR while any check is failing, including non-required checks, unless the user gives explicit exception approval.
- When proposing a quick fix, include a scheduled follow-up path to a stable solution in the same plan.
## Child-Agent and Delegation Policy
- Use child agents for scoped discovery, audits, multi-repo scans, and implementation planning before direct parent-agent edits.
- Delegate high-context or high-churn tasks to subagents and keep parent-agent writes narrowly focused on integration.
- Reserve parent-agent direct writes for the final decision layer.
- Favor clean, auditable handoffs and explicit integration checkpoints.
